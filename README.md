# Tailwind CSS Gradient Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug related to gradient rendering in Tailwind CSS. The issue involves unexpected behavior in gradient application.  The gradient might not render correctly, appear distorted, or not be visible at all.

## Bug Description

The provided HTML uses Tailwind's `bg-gradient-to-r` utility to create a linear gradient from blue to purple. However, the gradient does not apply correctly.  This could be due to issues with the Tailwind configuration, conflicting styles, or inconsistencies in the browser's CSS rendering.

## Solution

The solution involves checking the Tailwind CSS configuration, inspecting conflicting CSS rules, and verifying the browser's support for the used gradient syntax.  The `solution.html` demonstrates the issue corrected.
